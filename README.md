Overview/n
This project involves sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews, with a particular focus on comparing the performance and outputs of two sentiment analysis models: VADER and RoBERTa. The project aims to analyze customer sentiment, explore patterns in the data, and understand the relationship between sentiment scores and star ratings.

Data/n
The dataset used in this project consists of Amazon product reviews, including review text, product IDs, user IDs, star ratings, and other metadata. The raw data is processed to clean and prepare it for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Analysis/n
VADER/n
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based model for general sentiment analysis. It is particularly effective for social media text and short reviews. VADER returns sentiment scores for negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, along with a compound score that summarizes the overall sentiment.

RoBERTa/n
RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) is a transformer-based model developed by Facebook AI. It is fine-tuned on sentiment analysis tasks and is known for its state-of-the-art performance in understanding the context of sentences. Similar to VADER, RoBERTa provides sentiment scores for negative, neutral, and positive sentiments.

Visualization/n
The sentiment scores generated by VADER and RoBERTa are visualized using various plots to explore relationships between the models and the star ratings. Pair plots, in particular, are used to compare the distributions and correlations of the sentiment scores from both models.

Results/n
VADER Sentiment Analysis: Provides insight into how VADER's sentiment scores align with the star ratings.
RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis: Offers a more context-aware sentiment analysis, with potentially different interpretations of the review text.
Comparison of Models: Visual and statistical comparisons between the sentiment scores from VADER and RoBERTa reveal differences in how each model perceives sentiment in the reviews.
